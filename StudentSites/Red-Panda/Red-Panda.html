        The red panda was first classified and given its scientific name,
        Ailurus fulgens, in 1825

    <h1>Red Panda’s Appearance</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Red pandas can be easily identified by their unique ruddy coat color,
        which acts like camouflage within the canopy of fir trees where branches
        are covered with clumps of reddish-brown moss and white lichens.large,
        round heads and short snouts with big, pointed ears.

    <h1>Size and Weight</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Red Pandas grow to about 20-25 inches long with tails 11-19 inches long
        and weigh 6-14 pounds.

    <h1>Behavior</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Red pandas are crepuscular, arboreal and solitary. They are most active
        during the twilight hours of early morning and evening (crepuscular),
        spending most of the day resting in trees (arboreal), conserving their
        energy. Red pandas are normally solitary creatures but come together in
        pairs in the breeding season

    <h1>Red Panda habitat</h1>

        Red Pandas live in high-altitude, temperate forests with bamboo
        understories in the Himalayas and other high mountains

      <h1>10 Facts about the Red Panda That Makes Them Special</h1>
      <li>
        They have cute and easily recognizable appearance. The red panda can be
        easily identie. This color combination helps them camouflage from their
        predators, as they blend in great with the red moss, white lichen and
        yellow-orange-red foliage of their forest habitat.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are not closely related to the giant panda. Despite its name, the
        red panda isn’t actually closely related to the giant panda. In fact,
        the name 'panda' was first applied to it, and not to the larger
        black-and-white bear. Frédéric Cuvier, a French zoologist, first
        described the red panda in 1825, a few decades before the giant panda
        was cataloged. He called it the most beautiful animal he had ever seen.
      </li>
      <li>
        They have their own independent genetic family. Red pandas are the only
        living creatures in their family - Ailuridae. Actually, their taxonomic
        position has long been a subject of scientific debate. They were firstly
        classified in the raccoon family and then the bear family. Most recent
        genetic research, however, places red pandas in their own, independent
        family.
      </li>
      <li>
        They like eating bamboo and sweet food. Red pandas are the result of
        what naturalists call convergent evolution: they're classified asfied by
        its coat color - reddish brown above and black underneath with white
        markings on the fac carnivores, while like giant pandas, they feed
        mainly on bamboo. Red pandas are the result of what naturalists call
        convergent evolution: they're classified as carnivores, while like giant
        pandas, they feed mainly on bamboo. Red pandas supplement their diet
        with fruits, eggs, insects and birds, and they have a sweet tooth. It
        also share the giant panda's pseudo-thumb, a modified wrist bone used to
        grasp bamboo.
      </li>
      <li>
        They spend most of their time eating and sleeping. Considering the low
        nutrition content of their diet, red pandas are on a tight energy
        budget, so they spend most of their time sleeping and eating. In
        significantly cold temperatures, red pandas can become dormant. Their
        metabolic rate gets lower and increases only every few hours to wake
        them up so they can look for food.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are good at climbing trees. Red pandas are skilled climbers, using
        trees for shelter, to escape predators and to sunbathe. Their ankles are
        extremely flexible, and they can climb straight down a tree headfirst!
        Their long, sharp, semi-retractable claws help them traverse tree
        branches easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        They stand up when being provoked or threatened. Red pandas are able to
        stand on their hind legs. This is actually a defense mechanism as when
        provoked or threatened, standing up makes them appear larger. They may
        also make some loud noises, and even defend themselves with their sharp
        claws or release a foul smell from their scent glands. If you ever see a
        standing red panda you’d better keep your distance!
      </li>
      <li>
        Their tail plays an important role. The red panda has a long, thick
        bushy tail with alternating red and buff rings. It is used to help it
        maintain balance in the trees. It can be put around themselves for
        warmth during winter. It can even be used as a pillow when in bed!
      </li>
      <li>
        They are alone for the most of time. Red pandas are normally solitary
        creatures but come together in pairs in the breeding season. Just like
        the giant panda, the female red panda is only fertile for one or two
        days a year. After mating the female builds a nest or use hollow tree
        trunks or small caves to give birth. The male red panda rarely helps its
        female partner raising their babies.
      </li>
      <li>
        International Red Panda Day. A special day was set for red pandas - the
        International Red Panda Day. It is celebrated on the third Saturday of
        September every year since 2010 to raise public awareness and support
        for red panda conservation, as their lives are threatened by habitat
        loss and poaching. There may be as few as 10000 remaining in the wild,
        elusively found in the mountain forests of Asian countries such as
        Nepal, India, Bhutan, China and Myanmar. They are now being protected by
        legislation in China.

    <h1>Red Panda’s Diet</h1>
    <p>
      Red pandas are technically carnivores, but they've adapted to feed almost
      exclusively on bamboo. They eat roots, succulent grasses, fruits, insects
      and grubs, and are known to occasionally kill and eat birds and small
      mammals Red pandas feed mainly on leaves and bamboo, but occasionally
      snack on fruit, insects, bird eggs and small lizards, too. Red pandas are
      the result of what naturalists call convergent evolution: they're
      classified as carnivores, while like giant pandas, they feed mainly on
      bamboo. Red pandas supplement their diet with fruits, eggs, insects and
      birds, and they have a sweet tooth. Red pandas belong to the order
      Carnivora, but this has more to do with their biological classification
      than their actual diet. In reality they rarely eat meat, instead using
      their powerful molars to grind through up to four pounds of bamboo a day.
      They also sometimes eat fruit, acorns, roots, eggs, rodents, and birds.

    <h1>Red Panda’s Predators & Threats</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Their main threates are snow leopard and occasionally martens.
        Free-roaming dogs and disease are major contributors to red panda
        mortality. Herders in red panda range have dogs that protect their
        livestock from potential predators. They also kill red pandas. Dogs can
        also spread seven species of gastrointestinal parasites to red pandas.

    <h1>Interesting Adaptations About Red Pandas</h1>
    <li>
      Red Pandas have long, bushy tails that help them maintain balance and stay
      safe while traversing the canopy. Red pandas do not have paw pads and
      instead have fur covering the soles of their feet, which is believed to
      add extra insulation from the cold and help grip onto slippery, mossy
      branches.
